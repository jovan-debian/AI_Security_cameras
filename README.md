<!-- JSON File -->
## JSON File 📋

This template uses a simple JSON file (`users.json`) to store user information for quick setup and testing. While convenient for development, it's not suitable for production due to security concerns.

### Secure JSON File Operations:

- **Restrict Access**: Ensure proper file permissions to restrict access.

- **Backup Regularly**: Regularly back up the JSON file to prevent data loss.

- **Limit Sensitive Data**: Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the JSON file.

<!-- Security -->
## Security 🔐

This template follows security best practices:

- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm.

- **Session Management**: Flask session management for secure user authentication.

- **Secure Forms**: Proper validation and sanitation of user inputs in forms.

- **HTTPS**: Deploy the application with HTTPS for secure communication.

Always stay informed about the latest security updates and adapt the template accordingly.
